# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is a basic game of Rock Paper Scissors where you play against the computer.  
After 5 rounds the winner is annouced and the game may start again.  
Through this project I have learned:  
 * How to manipulate HTML elements    
 * Javascript coding logic    
 * How to add events to buttons    
 * How to make certain elements   visible only under some conditions  
 * How to edit .md files
